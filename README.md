## Geospatial Web

http://www.geospatialweb.ca

My sample website to showcase the code integration of Node, Express, Vue, Nuxt, Vuex, Mapbox GL, Deck.GL, PostGIS and Docker. The code repository above is production build code configured for Docker Compose instances.

The deck.gl experimental class ```MapboxLayer``` implemented here is currently supported in Google Chrome only.

The original Vue implementation is located in the ```vue-map``` repository.

 If you wish to serve locally, email me at johncampbell@geospatialweb.ca for the .env file.
 
 ```git clone https://github.com/geospatialweb/Nuxt.git```

 ```docker-compose up -d```
